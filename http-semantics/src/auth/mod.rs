//! RFC 9110 §11.2's two forms of authentication data: the `auth-param` every
//! authentication field in §11 is built out of, and the `token68` a credential
//! may carry in place of a whole list of them.
//!
//! ```text
//! token68    = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" / "+" / "/" ) *"="
//! auth-param = token BWS "=" BWS ( token / quoted-string )
//! ```
//!
//! §11.2 says in prose which of the two follows a scheme: "either a
//! comma-separated list of parameters or a single sequence of characters
//! capable of holding base64-encoded information". Nothing in
//! `challenge = auth-scheme [ 1*SP ( token68 / #auth-param ) ]` orders the
//! alternatives, so a recipient is the one that decides, and [`token68`] is
//! where this module writes that decision down.
//!
//! Removing the `BWS` is this module's own work rather than a courtesy to the
//! sender. §5.6.3: "A recipient MUST parse for such bad whitespace and remove
//! it before interpreting the protocol element." So `realm = "x"` and
//! `realm="x"` are one parameter spelled two ways, and both are read.
//!
//! # Why this walks its own parameter grammar
//!
//! The crate already has a §5.6.6 `parameter` walker, and an `auth-param` is
//! not one of those. Two differences, either alone enough to settle it:
//!
//! - **The whitespace.** `parameter = parameter-name "=" parameter-value` admits
//!   none, and §5.6.6's closing note says so outright: "Parameters do not allow
//!   whitespace" around the `=`, bad whitespace included. `auth-param` puts
//!   `BWS` on both sides of its own.
//! - **The separator.** `parameters = *( OWS ";" OWS [ parameter ] )` hangs a
//!   member's parameters off semicolons, while §11.2 spells its lists
//!   `#auth-param` — §5.6.1's comma-separated construct.
//!
//! [`crate::grammar::parameterised_list`] would therefore refuse `realm = "x"`,
//! which §11.2 requires be accepted, and
//! `a_bws_parameter_is_what_the_semicolon_walker_refuses` is that sentence made
//! executable rather than merely written down.
//!
//! What is NOT rewritten here is anything below the parameter. An
//! `auth-param`'s value is a real §5.6.4 quoted-string, `quoted-pair` included
//! — unlike §8.8.3's `opaque-tag`, the case that forced [`crate::validator`] to
//! carry a walk of its own — so §5.6.4's scanner, §5.6.2's `token`, §5.6.3's
//! whitespace skip and [`crate::grammar::ParamValue`] are the ones this crate
//! already holds.
// gate-exempt: realm = "x" — one field value shown in prose, carrying the BWS
// this module accepts; not a production of any RFC.
// gate-exempt: crate::validator — named for contrast: §8.8.3's `opaque-tag` is
// what forced a walk of its own there, and an `auth-param` value having a real
// `quoted-pair` is why none is forced here.

/// `foo=bar` is not — its pad has token bytes behind it, so the run stops
/// inside the element instead of ending it.
///
/// The end of `value` and that comma are one terminator rather than two: §5.2
/// joins repeated field lines into one value with a comma, so a run that
/// reaches the end of ONE line meets the comma next and is read the same way
/// either way.
///
/// At that comma the element is closed and nothing reopens it. A `#challenge`
/// walk tells a parameter of the CURRENT challenge from the scheme of the next
/// one by looking past the comma, and asking that question here instead could
/// change the answer only for an element both forms refuse: `Basic dGVzdA==,
/// realm=x` has no derivation either way, since `realm=x` is no challenge
/// without `1*SP` behind its token and `dGVzdA==` is no parameter. What such a
/// walk is left deciding is therefore which fault to report, never whether a
/// conforming value is read.
///
/// # Why taking it greedily steals nothing
///
/// No element this returns `Some` for is an `auth-param`, so answering the run
/// first can take no reading away from the other form. A run that reaches the
